# AI/ML Projects Portfolio

This repository serves as the master index of my structured journey toward becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.

Each major project is maintained in its own dedicated repository with clean architecture, documentation, and version control.

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate strong foundations in Python, SQL, data analysis, machine learning, and deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build industry-ready projects that demonstrate:

- Strong Python fundamentals  
- Database design and SQL proficiency  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Machine learning model development  
- End-to-end ML deployment

## 📈 Portfolio Strategy

This portfolio follows a structured execution plan:

1. Master Python fundamentals  
2. Strengthen SQL and database skills  
3. Build real-world data analysis workflows  
4. Develop practical machine learning models  
5. Deploy models into production-ready APIs  

Focus: Depth over quantity. Clean architecture. Real-world thinking.
