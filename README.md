# 🚀 AI/ML Projects Portfolio

This repository serves as the master index of my structured journey toward becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.

Each major project is maintained in its own dedicated repository with clean architecture, documentation, and version control.

This portfolio demonstrates strong foundations in **Python, SQL, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Deployment**.
