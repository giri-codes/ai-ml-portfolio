# AI/ML Projects Portfolio

This repository serves as the master index of my structured journey toward becoming an AI/ML Engineer.

Each major project is maintained in its own dedicated repository with clean architecture, documentation, and version control.

This portfolio follows a phase-based progression aligned with my Artificial Intelligence curriculum.

## 🎯 Objective

Build industry-ready AI/ML projects that demonstrate:

- Strong Python fundamentals  
- Data analysis and visualization skills  
- Machine learning model development  
- Deep learning implementation  
- NLP and computer vision applications  
- Model deployment and end-to-end system design
